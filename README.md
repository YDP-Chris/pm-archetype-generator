## ❤️ **For the PM Community**

This tool exists because PMs are wonderfully diverse in how we approach problems. Some of us live and breathe OKRs, others write user stories like poets, and some can spot a misaligned metric from across the office.

**All approaches are valuable.** This quiz celebrates that diversity.
